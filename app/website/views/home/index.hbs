                <p class="authors">by <a class="author">Nothe Littany</a> and <a class="author">Laarj Shaiip</a></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents, except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for
                       it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the house-tops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.</p>
                    <p>Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man, evidently of the lowest orders, was wending his
                       solitary way. He stopped twice or thrice at different shops and houses of a description correspondent with the appearance of the quartier in which they were situated, and
                       tended inquiry for some article or another which did not seem easily to be met with.</p>                           
                    <div class="picture">
                        <img src="http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2011/12/09/202529-me-gusta-rage-face.jpg" />
                    </div>
                    <p>All the answers he received were couched in the negative; and as he turned from each door he muttered to himself, in no very elegant phraseology, his disappointment and
                       discontent. At length, at one house, the landlord, a sturdy butcher, after rendering the same reply the inquirer had hitherto received, added, "But if this vill do as
                       vell, Dummie, it is quite at your sarvice!" Pausing reflectively for a moment, Dummie responded that he thought the thing proffered might do as well; and thrusting it
                       into his ample pocket, he strode away with as rapid a motion as the wind and the rain would allow.</p>
                    <p>He soon came to a nest of low and dingy buildings, at the entrance to which, in half-effaced characters, was written "Thames Court." Halting at the most conspicuous of
                       these buildings, an inn or alehouse, through the half-closed windows of which blazed out in ruddy comfort the beams of the hospitable hearth, he knocked hastily at the
                       door. He was admitted by a lady of a certain age, and endowed with a comely rotundity of face and person.</p>
